Typescript
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that adds static typing, interfaces, enums, and advanced tooling to JavaScript. It compiles (or "transpiles") down to plain JavaScript, so it can run anywhere JS runs (browser, Node.js, etc.).

1.allows to use javascript.
2.allows to use strict types
3.support modern features
4.extra features

Types:

1.once a variable is assigned your cant change it with another type data.
2. you can only reassign with same data.
3. we can pass input and its type to avoid errors.

Data binding :
 
  Data binding in Angular is essentially a way to establish a connection between the application's data and the UI components. It involves binding properties of components (such as input fields, labels, etc.) to data sources, like variables or models, so that changes in one automatically reflect in the other.

Types of Data Binding
Angular allows both One-way and Two-way Data Binding. We will study both of them in detail in the below section.

1. One-Way Binding
In one-way binding, data flows in a single direction, either from the component to the view (interpolation or property binding) or from the view to the component (event binding).

1. Interpolation
This involves displaying component data in the view by enclosing the property or expression in double curly braces, like {{ data }}. Angular automatically updates the view whenever the underlying data changes.

2. Property Binding
This is achieved by using square brackets to bind a property of an HTML element to a component property. For instance, [property]="data" binds the value of the component's "data" property to the HTML element's property.

3. Event Binding
This allows the view to communicate changes back to the component when an event occurs, such as a button click or input change. Event binding is denoted by parentheses, like (event)="handler()".
